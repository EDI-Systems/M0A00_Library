# Libraries

## Description
EDI's operating systems rely on these libraries to work. For example projects to compile, place the M0P0_Library folder on the same level with the other repos. The documentations for these libraries are stripped to make the repo leaner; if you need them, please download them at respective vendor websites.

The folder tree should look as follows:
- Main Folder
  - M0P0_Library
    - Various libraries
  - M5P1_MuProkaron
  - M7M1_MuEukaron
  - M7M2_MuAmmonite
